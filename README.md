# INFO201-Project
This project is for the INFO 201 class taught by Dr. Ott Toomet. Our project utilizes the coding language R Studio, and we utilize various data process skills such as data merging and data cleaning. The dataset we use is a country birth rate from the Worldbank. We compared the two countries: China and USA as they are some of the giants in the international industry currently. Especially, with China's interesting law about limiting children in household few years ago we wish to understand the economy and industry changes because of that. We used data cleaning to get rid of the unnecessary countries and information that is not needed for our project. We then used this new dataset and assigned variables to certain  categorical variables such as income group. We wished to do this to show various government officials and other elected officials handling birth rate and economy the pros and cons of the increasing or decreasing birthrate since the cost of having a family has been increasing in recent times. [merged_dataset3.csv](https://github.com/vshah31/INFO201-Project/files/13628953/merged_dataset3.csv) Attached is the new merged dataset that we have that we utilized to create our visualizations. I hope this project can tell everyone a story about the supply and demand of having a family in this current day and age.
